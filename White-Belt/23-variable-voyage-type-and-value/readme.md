### Description

Write a program that declares variables of different data types (integer, floating-point, character, and boolean), assigns them values, and then prints their values and types.  The program should handle potential type mismatches gracefully (e.g., avoid explicit type casting). 

### Constraints

- The program should use at least one variable of each of the specified data types.
- The program must print the value and type of each variable. Type printing should be clear and human-readable. For example: "Integer: 10", "Float: 3.14", etc.
- Error handling is not required for this problem.

### Example

**Input:** (No direct input; values are assigned within the program)
**Output:**

Integer: 10
Float: 3.14
Character: A
Boolean: true


### Concepts Covered

Variable declaration, data types (integer, float, char, boolean), variable assignment, input/output operations, basic print formatting.
