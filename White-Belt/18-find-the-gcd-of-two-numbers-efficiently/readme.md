### Description

Write a function that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for computing the GCD.

### Constraints

*   `0 <= num1, num2 <= 1000`

### Example


Input: num1 = 48, num2 = 18
Output: 6
