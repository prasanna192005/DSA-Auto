# Recursive Factorial

**Problem Description:**
Write a function that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using recursion. The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

**Constraints:**
* The input integer n will be a non-negative integer.

**Examples:**
* Input: 5
  Output: 120
* Input: 0
  Output: 1
* Input: 3
  Output: 6
* Input: 1
  Output: 1
