### Description

You've been tasked with creating a Martian calculator!  This calculator performs simple arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and checks if the result satisfies certain logical conditions.  Given two integer inputs (A and B), calculate their sum, difference, product, and quotient.  Then, determine if the sum is greater than 10, the difference is less than -5, the product is even, and the quotient (integer division) is zero.

### Constraints

- A and B are integers.
- B cannot be zero for the division operation.
- A and B will be within the range of [-100, 100].

### Example

Input: A = 15, B = 5
Output:
Sum: 20, Greater than 10: True
Difference: 10, Less than -5: False
Product: 75, Even: False
Quotient: 3, Zero: False

### Concepts Covered

Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /), Relational Operators (> , <), Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)
