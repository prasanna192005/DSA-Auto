# Linear Search Best/Worst/Average Case

**Problem Description:**
Given an unsorted array of integers and a target integer, implement a linear search algorithm to find the target.  Determine and report the best-case, worst-case, and average-case time complexities of your implementation.

**Constraints:**
* The array will contain only integers.
* The target integer will be an integer.
* The array size will be between 1 and 1000.
* The integers in the array will be between -1000 and 1000.

**Example:**

**Input:**
`arr = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 4, 7, 3, 6], target = 8`

**Output:**
`Index: 2`
`Best-case time complexity: O(1)`
`Worst-case time complexity: O(n)`
`Average-case time complexity: O(n)`
