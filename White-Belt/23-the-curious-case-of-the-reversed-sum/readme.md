### Description

Given two integers, `a` and `b`, return their sum reversed.  For example, if a = 12 and b = 34, the sum is 46, and the reversed sum is 64.

### Constraints

- `a` and `b` will be integers between -1000 and 1000 (inclusive).

### Example

Input: a = 12, b = 34
Output: 64

Input: a = -5, b = 10
Output: 5

### Concepts Covered

- Function return values
- Integer arithmetic
- String manipulation (optional, for easier reversal)
