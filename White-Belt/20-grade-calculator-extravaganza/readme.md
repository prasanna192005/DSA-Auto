### Description
Write a function that calculates a student's final grade based on their scores in three exams. The function should take three integer scores as input (each out of 100) and return the average score as a floating-point number.

### Constraints
- Each exam score will be an integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
- The function should handle potential integer overflow gracefully (although unlikely with these constraints).
- The function should return the average with at least two decimal places of precision.

### Example
Input: 85, 92, 78
Output: 85.00

### Concepts Covered
Function definition, function calls, data type conversion (integer to float), arithmetic operations, return values, input/output handling.
