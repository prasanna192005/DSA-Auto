# Delete Middle Node of Linked List

**Problem Description:**
Given a singly linked list, delete the node that is located in the middle of the list. If the list has an even number of nodes, delete the second middle node.  You cannot use extra space (e.g., another array or linked list).  Assume the list has at least one node.

**Constraints:**
* The input is a singly linked list.
* The list contains at least one node.
* You cannot use extra space beyond O(1) constant space.
* The list nodes are integers.

**Example:**

**Input:**  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
**Output:** 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5

**Input:** 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
**Output:** 1 -> 2 -> 4
